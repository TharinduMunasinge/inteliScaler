\section{Future Improvements}
It is possible to improve the proposed heuristic by introducing different penalty functions  based on the level of service expected by different users. For example, an application (deployed on a PaaS) that supports free as well as paid versions would require different service levels. Our proposed solution can be adapted for such scenarios by defining different penalty functions based on the type of subscription.
