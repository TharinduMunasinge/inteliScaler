\section{Conclusion}

Autoscaling is of vital importance to realize the full potential of cloud computing. However current auto scaling solutions available in PaaS cloud remain primitive. Almost all the PaaS providers rely on reactive approach and lacks workload awareness needed for detailed decision making and rely on rule based decision making which expect users to set threshold parameters. 

To address these problems we propose auto scaling solution inteliscaler with\\
i)  Ensemble workload prediction mechanism based on time series and machine learning techniques \\ 
ii) Scaling algorithm that considers both cost and QoS factors when deciding the amount of resources required\\
iii)Pricing model aware decision making\\

We tested proposed model in two levels. First we evaluated the performance of individual components on simulation set-up. Second we developed entire solution on Apache Stratos PaaS framework and test with deployment on Amazon EC2. Empirical result in both level shows significant benefits for PaaS users.
