test case & average   & requests  & requests   & time out  \\ 
\ & response time & initiated & completed & errors \hline

low threshold & 6.3839 s & 254535 & 203067 & 2511\\ \hline

high threshold & 4.4954 s & 280477 & 191891  & 11863\\ \hline

inteliScaler & 5.1288 s & 286180 & 261979  & 2278\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It is clear that inteliScaler outperforms both configurations of Stratos as shown in figure \ref{graph:workload_3}. InteliScaler has allocated less number of VM's to handle the same workload. In terms of QoS inteliScaler has a success ratio of 91.54\%, which is significantly higher than, the 80\% of low threshold configuration and 68\% of high threshold configuration. Number of time out errors is also significantly low where in inteliScaler it is  0.8\%, in low threshold configuration it is 0.9\%  and in high threshold configuration it is  4.2\%.

\subsubsection{Workload II}
We also tested both Stratos and inteliScaler with a fluctuating yet growing workload as described in table \ref{table:workload_5}.
