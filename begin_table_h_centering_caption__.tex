\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline

test case & average   & requests  & requests   & time out  \\
& response time & initiated & completed & errors\\ \hline

low threshold & 6.3839 s & 254535 & 203067 & 2511\\ \hline

high threshold & 4.4954 s & 280477 & 191891  & 11863\\ \hline

inteliScaler & 5.1288 s & 286180 & 261979  & 2278\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It is clear that inteliScaler outperforms both configurations of Stratos as shown in Figure 8. InteliScaler has allocated less number of VM's to handle the same workload. In terms of QoS inteliScaler has a success ratio of 91.54\%, which is significantly higher than, the 80\% of low threshold configuration and 68\% of high threshold configuration. Number of time out errors is also significantly low where in inteliScaler it is  0.8\%, in low threshold configuration it is 0.9\%  and in high threshold configuration it is  4.2\%. 

\subsubsection{Workload II}
We also tested both Stratos and inteliScaler with a fluctuating yet growing workload as described in table \ref{table:workload_5}.
