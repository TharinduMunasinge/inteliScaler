Next sections are organized as follows. Section 4 describes the proposed workload prediction mechanism. Section 5 introduces the proposed scaling algorithm. Also we discuss IaaS pricing model considerations in Section 5. Section 6 presents theoretical evaluation of the proposed scaling algorithm and resource allocation mechanism.
