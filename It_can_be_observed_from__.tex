It can be observed from \ref{dif_instance} that smaller the instance, lower the resource cost and total cost. But percentage of performance violations tends to be higher. On the other hand larger instance incur higher resource cost but lower performance degradation. At top level in the graph performance violation is cost therefore no  violation incurred.

Considering the added complexity in handling heterogeneous platform, we entirely focused on homogeneous clusters when implementing the solution on Apache Stratos. However some research \cite{hetero} has been conducted on heterogeneous autoscaling and it is possible area of improvement for inteliscaler.
