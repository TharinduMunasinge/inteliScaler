\section{Simulation Setup}
Simulation models provide a convenient way of analyzing the performance of algorithms. For our purpose we built our own analytical model to reflect the performance behavior exhibited by the default Apache Stratos auto-scaler and that of our inteliScaler. To evaluate the performance of inteliScaler against realistic workloads, we use the widely used traces from the WorldCup98\cite{website:worldcup} and several other cloud workload datasets gathered from Google Cluster Data[], a sports website[], and from a cloud based HR system[]. \\
