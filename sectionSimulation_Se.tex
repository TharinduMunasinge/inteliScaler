\section{Simulation Setup}
Simulation models provide a convenient way of analysing the performance of algorithms. For our purpose we built our own analytical model to reflect the performance behavior exhibited by the default Apache Stratos auto scaler and that of our inteliScaler. To evaluate the performance of inteliScaler against realistic workloads, we use the widely used traces from the WorldCup98\cite{website:worldcup} and several other cloud workload datasets gathered from Google Cluster Data[], a sports website[], and from a cloud based HR system[]. \\
