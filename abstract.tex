In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of inteliScaler, which is a workload and resource aware, proactive auto scaler for the open cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS). Our solution overcomes the inadequacy and inefficiency in the existing PaaS auto scalers which prominently operate on top of rule based engines. Simulation results using the RUBiS application and empirical workload traces show significant cost and energy savings by inteliScaler compared to a typical PaaS auto scaler.
