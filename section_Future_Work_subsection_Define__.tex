\section{Further Improvements}
\subsection{Inclusion of a Performance Model}
Current implementation of inteliScaler is focused on a limited set of instances, since we were not able to conduct research for all the instance types available at AWS due to the cost factor. For completion of the solution, a performance model is required for mapping the workload requirement with a suitable instance type configuration available at the IaaS layer. This depends heavily on the application being deployed, but in general we will be able to accurately define the limitations of each resource type for a generic workload.

\subsection{Support for Heterogeneity}
Our solution as well as the current auto-scaling implementation on Apache Stratos assumes homogeneity of the worker nodes (members or instances). Although this results in a simpler resource management model, it prevents Stratos from enjoying many benefits and profitable aspects of heterogeneous deployment, including spawning of instances with specialized resource capacities (e.g., a memory-optimized instance when the cluster is facing memory deficiencies rather than high load averages or requests-in-flight counts) and choosing combinations of different instance types to fulfill a given resource demand while minimizing total cost. However, implementing heterogeneity on the current Stratos architecture would include a substantial amount of changes to the existing code base.
