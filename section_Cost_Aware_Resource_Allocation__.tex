\section{Cost-Aware Resource Allocation}\\
Most of the public PaaS solutions like Google App Engine provide SLAs based on the QoS provided. According to these SLAs, a penalty will be charged from the provider to the PaaS user in a case where the provider was unable to provide the agreed level of service. In most cases this penalty is defined as a percentage of the monthly cost of users.

We propose a greedy heuristic scaling algorithm inspired by already existing PaaS SLAs. However, unlike most PaaS providers, we do not consider service uptime as the measure of QoS, instead we consider any performance degradation with respect to the matrix considered (Memory Consumption, CPU Utilization, Requests in Flight) as a violation.

\subsection{Scaling Algorithm}
Considering both resource cost and the penalty for performance degradation, we define the total cost in the next T minutes as follows.\\
\\
\textbf{$$ C_t(n) = C_{ins}.n  + C_{ins} . n . f(\frac{v_i}{T}.100) $$}
\textbf{$$n_{opt} = argmin_{n \in N \ \land \ n \in [min, max]}C_t(n)$$} \\
\\

Here $f$ is a predefined function which calculate penalizing factor based on the percentage of performance degradation.$T$ is the total time for prediction,$C_t(n)$ is the total cost for time T, and $C_{ins}$ is the cost for an instance, where n is the number of instances and $v_i$ is the violation time. 
\\
Figure-2 illustrate how proposed algorithm works. Using the above definition, we calculate the total cost for different numbers of instances, n. Increasing the number of instances increases resource cost, but decreases penalty factor (and therefore the violation cost). Considering values from the minimum number of VMs(shown in bottommost line in figure) to the maximum number of VMs allowed(shown in topmost line in figure), we decide an optimum number that minimizes the total cost. Such an exhaustive search is made possible by the bounded and relatively small range of VM count in most set-ups.
