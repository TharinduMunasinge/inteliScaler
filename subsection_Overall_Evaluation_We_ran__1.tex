\subsection{Overall Evaluation}

We ran several workloads, with drastically different characteristics, on the actual implementation of Apache Stratos and inteliScaler deployed in AWS EC2 setup.

\subsubsection{Workload I}
First we tested the same workload that was used earlier as shown in table \ref{table:analysis_workload} against inteliScaler.  Configurations of the Stratos are same as described in table \ref{table:policy_low_threshold} and table \ref{table:policy_high_threshold}.
