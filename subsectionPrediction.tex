\subsection{Evaluation of Resource Allocation}
\subsubsection{Behaviour of Different Auto-scaling Approaches}
We evaluated proposed approach using different workloads. Fig. \ref{stratos}, \ref{reactive}, and \ref{proactive} show resource allocation of proposed algorithm based on Load Average Statistics from RUBIS workload on AWS deployment.
