\section{Overall Solution - inteliScaler}
We propose an automated scaling service for the PaaS systems that would take scaling decisions based on the characteristics of the application while considering the operational cost including the penalty cost. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:mesh1} there are two main components in our solution, each being individually responsible for one aspect of the scaling decision. \textit{Workload Predictor} predicts the future workload by processing statistic from the Real Time Event Processor. Prediction results are then sent to the Resource Monitor. \textit{Resource Monitor} is responsible for resource allocation and deallocation. Resouce Monitor consists of two subcomponents, namely Resource Quantifier and Cost Optimizer. \textit{Resource Quantifier} decides the number of instances required to handle predicted or anticipated workload. \textit{Cost Optimizer} handles qualitative aspect by deciding which instances to spin-down or which type of instance to spin-up while taking the pricing models of underlying IaaS into consideration.
