\section{inteliScalerl Architecture}
We propose a completely automated scaling service for the PaaS systems that would take scaling decisions based on the characteristics of the application while considering the operational cost including the SLA violation cost. There are three main components in our solution, each being individually responsible for one aspect of the scaling decision.\\
