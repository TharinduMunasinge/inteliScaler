\label{table:analysis_qos_workload_5}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline

test case & average  response time & requests initiated & requests completed & time out errors \\ \hline

Stratos & 2.7150 s & 178848 & 102671 & 16257\\ \hline

inteliScaler & 1.1207 s & 214041 & 201719 & 6988\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As shown in figure \ref{graph:workload_5} inteliScaler has the lowest resource allocation of 10 VMs whereas for the same workload Apache Stratos allocates 15 VMs, saving the cost for 5 VM's. Also the QoS of inteliScaler is better than Stratos as shown in table \ref{table:analysis_qos_workload_5}. inteliScaler has responded to 94.24\% of the requests generated whereas Stratos has responded to only for 57.41\% of the total requests generated. There is a significant time out and drop off error in Stratos compared to inteliScaler, which is the reason for these figures.
